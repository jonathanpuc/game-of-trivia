A trivia application built with the amazing Vue.js framework.

# How to play
Answer each question before the timer hits 0, failure to do so will result in a loss of HP.
If timer is at 0, users are still required to answer the question, and answering incorrectly will also result in a loss of HP.
This means your HP suffers twice.

Upon each question the timer will be reset.

Survive the barrage of questions while maintaining your HP above 0, failure to do so will result in death.
